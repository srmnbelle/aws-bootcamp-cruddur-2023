# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## LECTURES

### Live Stream | [Free AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp - Week 0 - Billing and Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG8blanhAOg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=11)

- From Margaret, our first speaker, I learned about the project scenario from her "user persona"-way of story telling. I learned in general that we are going to work on Cruddr, a twitter-like social media platform with expiring posts. For front-end, we're using Java and React. For back-end, we're using Python using Flask. And for APIs, we're using "Object Relational Mapping (ORM)". We're also going to utilize AWS but with great consideration on budget costs.
- From Chris, I learned the importance of MEETING requirements, and ADDRESSING the risks, assumptions, and constraints to create a good architecture. To create the designs, there are high-level to low-level types of design from conceptual, logical to physical design.
